# Overview

Expensify allows you to request reimbursement for mileage by creating a distance request from a map. You can send a distance request in Expensify's mobile app, desktop app, or web app.


# How to create and send a distance request

1. Click the green '+' button and select Request Money.
2. Select Distance along the top row of the Request Money window.
3. Enter the Start and Finish addresses then click Next. If there are multiple stops, you can add them before clicking Next.
4. Select your organization's workspace from the list of recent workspaces.
5. On the confirmation page, confirm the amount, Date, and Distance, and optionally enter a Description and Category. Click the Request button.
6. A workspace admin will receive your request and can reimburse you through Expensify or elsewhere!



# FAQs


## How can I change the mileage rate used on my distance requests or add an additional rate?

If you use a group workspace, then you can change the rate in your Workspace settings. In Expensify Classic, go to Settings > Workspaces > [Your Workspace] > Expenses > Distance > Add a Mileage Rate. If you submit mileage expenses on a group workspace, you must be a workspace admin to make changes.

Individual workspaces offer a single default mileage rate that is aligned with the current IRS mileage reimbursement rate.
